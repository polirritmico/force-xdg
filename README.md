XDG-Wrapper
===========

A BASH script to launch non xdg compliant programs to fake a XDG structure. It
will move the `$XDG_DATA_HOME/APP` folder to `$HOME/.APP` before launch and
move to `XDG_DATA_HOME/APP` the folder when the programm is closed.

## Installation

Just copy it to `/usr/local/bin/` or any of your custom paths.
Also `make` can be used to do it automatically:

```
git clone https://github.com/polirritmico/xdg-wrapper.git
make install
```

## Usage

When running for the first time a program with `xdg-wrapper` the script make a
list of files and folders before and after the execution and store in a little
text file to handle the hidden directories and files. Is ***strongly
recommended*** to close the program on its first run with the script as soon as
posible to get a clean file list. This list is used by the script to move files
on program run and close between `$HOME` and the `$XDG_DATA_HOME` folder.

### From the terminal:

```command
$ xdg-wrapper -help
```

```command
XDG-Wrapper v0.1
A simple BASH script to simulate XDG paths and clean HOME.

Usage: xdg-wrapper [OPTION]... [PROGRAM]
       xdg-wrapper [OPTION]... [PROGRAM] [PROGRAM ARGS]

Move hidden polluting files from [HOME] to [XDG_DATA_HOME]/XDG-Wrapper/ folder.
When [PROGRAM] is run for the first time is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to close it
immediately to get a clean file list. The script compare the state of [HOME]
before and after the first execution to make a folders and files list based on
the changes.

                   ($XDG_DATA_HOME/XDG-Wrapper by default)
