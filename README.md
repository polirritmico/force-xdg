XDG-Wrapper
===========

A BASH script to launch non xdg compilant programs to fake a XDG structure. It
will move the `$XDG_DATA_HOME/APP` folder to `$HOME/.APP` before launch and
move to `XDG_DATA_HOME/APP` the folder when the programm is closed.

## Usage

When running for the first time a program with `xdg-wrapper` the script make a
list of files and folders before and after the execution and store in a little
text file to handle the hidden directories and files. Is ***strongly
recommended*** to close the program on its first run with the script as soon as
posible to get a clean file list. This list is used by the script to move files
on program run and close between `$HOME` and the `$XDG_DATA_HOME` folder.
